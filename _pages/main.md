I am a final-year PhD student at TU Wien advised by [Thomas Gärtner](https://thomasgaertner.org/).
My research interests lie in the intersection of _machine learning_ and _classical algorithmics_.
My goal is to perform research that combines applied machine learning with a
strong theoretical and mathematical basis.

## News

- (October) [New arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13615): Expressive edge-based GNNs that are near-linear time with well characterized expressivity (in terms of homomorphism counting and first-order logic).
- (May) [New arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11298): Higher GNN expressivity can lead to worse generalization unless balanced by dataset size.
- (April) I have passed my proficiency evaluation. Many thanks to the committee: Professors Michael Bronstein, Thomas Gärtner and Emanuel Sallinger.
