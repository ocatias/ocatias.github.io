I am a second-year PhD student at TU Wien advised by [Thomas Gärtner](https://thomasgaertner.org/).
My research interests lie in the intersection of _machine learning_ and _classical algorithmics_.
Currently, I am focusing on the _expressiveness of graph neural networks_.
My goal is to perform research that combines applied machine learning with a
strong theoretical and mathematical basis.
